# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    # the idea is to use dfs to traverse the tree from all root to leaf paths
    # `path` is used to store the current route 
    # `remainingSum` is used to store thre remaining sum that we need with the initial value `targetSum`.
    #  we substract it from the node value when we traverse down the tree
    # if we arrive the leaf and the the remaining sum is eqaul to leaf node value
    # then we can add `path` to ans
    # e.g. path = [5,4,11,2] and remainingSum = targetSum = 22
    # traverse node 5, remainingSum = 22 - 5 = 17
    # traverse node 4, remainingSum = 17 - 4 = 13
    # traverse node 11, remainingSum = 13 - 11 = 2
    # traverse node 2, remainingSum = 2 - 2 = 0
    # remainingSum is 0 which means the sum of current path is eqaul to targetSum
    # so how to find another path?
    # we can backtrack here
    # we can pop back a node and try another
    # e.g. path = [5, 4, 11, 7]
    # pop 7 out = [5, 4, 11]
    # push 2 = [5, 4, 11, 2]
    # ... etc
    def dfs(self, root, path, ans, remainingSum):
        # if it is None, then return
        if not root:
            return
        # add the current node val to path
        path.append(root.val)
        # !node.left && !node.right : check if it is a leaf node
        # remainingSum == node.val: check if the remaining sum - node.val == 0
        # if both condition is true, then we find one of the paths
        if not root.left and not root.right and remainingSum == root.val:
            ans.append(list(path))
        # traverse left sub tree with updated remaining sum
        # we don't need to check if left sub tree is nullptr or not
        # as we handle it in the first line of this function
